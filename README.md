**Description:** A C-version of the command-line utility sqlite3. Some of the features of the database editor / creator of sqlite3 have been implemented, but not all of them, as that would be too much work for two students to complete. This database utility is capable of file locking, creating and deleting tables, and selecting data from and inserting data to a table.
