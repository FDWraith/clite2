    Started work on process.c

    Finished about half of process.c
    Done with reading from the database, but not writing to the database.
    This turned out to be a lot longer than I thought, and will probably require heavy testing before I move along.

    Debugging process.c
    Managed to get a large portion of the reading portion working. Will be working on writing tomorrow
    readTables and openFileAttempt are still untested, although I will test them very soon.
