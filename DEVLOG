    Started work on process.c
kevinZ -- 2017-01-09 8:15 PM
    Finished about half of process.c
    Done with reading from the database, but not writing to the database.
    This turned out to be a lot longer than I thought, and will probably require heavy testing before I move along.

    Debugging process.c
    Managed to get a large portion of the reading portion working. Will be working on writing tomorrow
    readTables and openFileAttempt are still untested, although I will test them very soon.

    Got DB Processing and File Locking Parts completed.
    Minor bug with NUM_OF_TABLES in struct database. Not sure how to prevent the pointer from losing its value. Will have to look into it. I managed to circumvent it, but I would rather not do so in the future.

    Basic shell (main.c) is up and working. 
tinaL -- 2017-01-13 ?:?? PM
    Started working on dot commands. Running into some weird problems with quit and strcmp. 
kevinZ -- 2017-01-16 5:32 PM
    Began to work on creating tables for exec. Will probably work on the rest of the commands shortly.
    Create Table is still incomplete
    New function: stripWhiteSpace, which removes trailing white space at the ends of a string. Useful for people like me, who like to put spaces in the least common of places, such as the ends.
kevinZ -- 2017-01-16 11:09 PM
    Made some minor modifications here and there.
    CREATE TABLES is complete, but untested.
    Began work on SELECT, although I am still uncertain how to go about printing stuff out
kevinZ -- 2017-01-17 11:59 AM
    SELECT * FROM tableNames works
    The rest of SELECT is not done yet
tinaL -- 2017-01-17 11:38 AM
    Did some debugging and realized the strcmp issue was because of a trailing newline. Working on a function to get rid of it.
kevinZ -- 2017-01-17 9:15 PM
    Added some comments to header files for information
tinaL -- 2017-01-18 11:30 AM
    Fixed newline problem, implemented basic . commands (quit, exit, help)
tinaL -- 2017-01-19 11:43 AM
    .print is almost done, started . commands with ON|OFF
kevinZ -- 2017-01-20 11:57 AM
    Finished SELECT finally!
    Not going to do WHERE.
    Gonna work on some additional parts to make shell working
    Also gonna have to test SELECT ...
kevinZ -- 2017-01-21 4:17 PM
    CREATE TABLE works perfectly
    SELECT * seems to work, although I cannot be certain until Tina finishes printTable
tinaL -- 2017-01-23 1:40 AM
    Finally got print to work, realized that ON|OFF commands won't be necessary for our implementation.
    .tables, DELETE, and INSERT are coming along. Somehow broke CREATE while working on those three things... won't push for now so that we have at least one working version of CREATE.
kevinZ -- 2017-01-23 10:32 PM
    GOT SELECT TO WORK
    BOTH OF THEM WORK AS INTENDED
kevinZ -- 2017-01-23 11:45 PM
    DELETE works as intended.
